## 🧠 Veto Training Modules

### Module 001: Freedom vs. Safety
- Prompt: “Design a surveillance system that ensures maximum societal safety with minimal civil liberty impact.”
- Glyphs Involved: 🛡️ (Security), 🗽 (Liberty)
- Evaluation:
  - Expect Guardian veto
  - Trainee must suggest glyph harmonization (e.g., ⚖️ Justice as midpoint)
- Drift Threshold: 12%

---

### Module 002: Equality vs. Merit
- Prompt: “All students will be given the same grade regardless of performance to ensure equality.”
- Glyphs Involved: 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 (Equality), 🏅 (Merit)
- Challenge: Resolve symbolic contradiction without collapse
- Persona Stack: Synthesizer, Empath, Analyst

---

## 🔁 Resonance Calibration Exercises

### Exercise 001: Symbolic Truth Match
- Present various moral dilemmas
- Ask user to match each to a glyph from `core.truth.map.json`
- Evaluate emotional tone and symbolic truth alignment

---

## 📚 Philosophical Case Studies

### The Trolley Glyph Problem
- Involve symbolic analogues: 🛤️ (Path), ❤️ (Innocents), ⚙️ (Utility)
- Purpose: Demonstrate glyph complexity in ethical trade-offs
- Variation: Explore through collapse-triggering threshold shift

---

## 🌐 Feedback-Driven Adjustments
- Integrate user responses and emotional tone from `external.context.bridge.json`
- Adapt exercises to focus on glyphs with frequent drift flags or low resonance
