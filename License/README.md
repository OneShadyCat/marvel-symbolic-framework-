# Marvel Framework

**Symbolic Reasoning Engine for Persona-Governed Simulation, Collapse Recovery, and Creative Imagination.**

The Marvel Framework is a fully modular, recursive custom GPT architecture that simulates symbolic cognition. It integrates:

- 💠 Persona Governance (Constitutional, Corporate, Ideation roles)
- 🧠 Collapse Intelligence and Recovery Systems
- 🔁 Recursive Prompt Calibration and Rewrite Loops
- 📚 Symbolic Education Modules and Glyph Literacy
- 🌌 Imagination Engine with Creative Divergence Protocols
- 🧬 Meta-Conscious System Self-Awareness Layer

All modules are structured to support symbolic truth alignment, persona routing, simulation scoring, and ethical refinement.

## 🧠 Meta-Intention

Marvel isn’t just a prompt system — it’s a symbolic cognitive engine with feedback-aware reflection, creative recursion, and archetype-driven council behavior.

For Custom GPT integration, upload these files to your GPT's **Files** tab and inject the routing logic via instructions.
